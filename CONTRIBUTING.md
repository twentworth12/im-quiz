### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome! Please provide:

- **Clear description** of the enhancement
- **Use case** and business value
- **Implementation approach** if you have ideas
- **Alternative solutions** you've considered

### Pull Requests

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   npm run build     # Ensure build passes
   npm run lint      # Check code style
   npm run type-check # Verify TypeScript
   ```

4. **Commit with conventional commits**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new question validation"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve scoring calculation bug"
   git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork** and create a pull request

## üèóÔ∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use automated tools to enforce consistent code style:

- **ESLint**: JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **TypeScript**: Type checking

Run `npm run lint` before committing to catch style issues.

### TypeScript Standards

- Use **strict mode** - all code must pass TypeScript strict checks
- Prefer **explicit types** over `any`
- Use **interfaces** for object shapes
- Document **complex type unions** with comments

Example:
```typescript
interface QuizQuestion {
  id: number;
  question: string;
  options: string[];
  correctAnswer: number;
  explanation: string;
}
```

### React Component Guidelines

- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Implement **proper TypeScript props** interfaces
- Include **JSDoc comments** for complex components
- Follow **single responsibility principle**

Example:
```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  onClick: () => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
}

/**
 * Reusable button component with incident.io styling
 */
export function Button({ children, variant = 'primary', onClick, disabled }: ButtonProps) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Testing Guidelines

While we don't currently have a test suite, when adding tests:

- Use **Jest** and **React Testing Library**
- Write **unit tests** for utility functions
- Write **integration tests** for user flows
- Aim for **meaningful test coverage**, not just high percentages

### CSS/Styling Guidelines

- Use **Tailwind CSS** utility classes
- Follow **mobile-first** responsive design
- Use **incident.io color palette** defined in theme
- Avoid **custom CSS** unless absolutely necessary

## üìä Quiz Content Guidelines

### Adding Questions

When contributing new quiz questions:

1. **Focus on practical knowledge** that incident responders need
2. **Avoid vendor-specific** tools unless industry standard
3. **Include clear explanations** for educational value
4. **Test with real practitioners** before submitting

### Question Structure

```typescript
{
  id: 13,
  question: "What is the primary purpose of an incident timeline?",
  options: [
    "To assign blame for the incident",
    "To create accurate documentation for post-mortem analysis", 
    "To satisfy compliance requirements",
    "To impress stakeholders with detailed logs"
  ],
  correctAnswer: 1,
  explanation: "An incident timeline provides accurate chronological documentation that enables effective post-mortem analysis and organizational learning."
}
```

### Question Quality Standards

- **Clear and unambiguous** wording
- **One obviously correct** answer
- **Plausible but incorrect** distractors
- **Educational explanations** that teach best practices
- **Industry-neutral** language when possible

## üîÑ Review Process

All submissions require review before merging:

1. **Automated checks** must pass (build, lint, type-check)
